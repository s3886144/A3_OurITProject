					<p><strong>PLASSS-tech</strong>
					<p>Student number: S3883080</P><p>I am a 37-year-old male born and currently living in Adelaide, South Australia. My nationality is Australian and I have Swedish/Irish Heritage. I speak English as well as bits of Italian and Swedish. Currently, I have no employment history in the IT sector but I did complete a certificate III in Network Administration at Adelaide TAFE in 2002.</p><p>I have a keen interest in Information Technology, particularly within the Cybersecurity field. I have a wonderful family with a wife and we have 2 boys both under the age of four that keeps us a bit busy. I have come from a Warehousing and Logistics background (with around 20 years’ experience) and would often work a second job as a Music Teacher (guitar) at a Music school in the evenings.</p><p>Currently, I am working with a large automotive company and I am doing tasks such as servicing/fixing large diesel engines and doing purchasing. When my boys aren’t keeping me busy, I also enjoy playing cricket for my local club in the summer and I enjoy watching motorsport and football.

<br><h3><strong>Personality Tests </strong></h3><br>
</header>
<p><h4>Myers-Briggs Test</h4></p>
<p>I got a test result of Turbulent Defender (ISFJ-T). A Turbulent Defender has many good characteristics. One is that I always try to support people and offer help when I see someone that may need it. I am also very positive and I always try to see the situations in a good light rather than dwell on mistakes. A defender is aso reliable, patient and we are always striving to help each other when needed which will come in handy in groups. A disadvantage to the ‘Defender’ type is the trait of being humble and shy. This probably used to be an issue for me when I was younger as I had a stammer. I don’t have a stammer anymore so I don’t really see myself as shy anymore so I am hoping it doesn’t impact my group.</p>
<p><h4>Learning Styles Test</h4></p>
<p>I received the result of “visual learner”. Visual learner’s strengths are when information is written down or presented in a diagram or graph. I find this particularly true as when I write things down, I tend to remember them a lot easier. Therefore, when I am in meetings I always try to create notes to jog my memory. Also another item I would like to do in this group is to listen to our groups meetings and make notes after. I find this helps me alot to find out how much information has stayed with me.</p>
<p><h4>Enneagram Test</h4></p>
<p>This test listed my result as a Category 1. Category ones tend to thrive on order and they show great commitment and determination in areas that need improvement. A Category one also thrives on helping others achieve their best outcomes and show a fortitude in improving items they think need refinement. A good group trait is that I also can be very encouraging to others when they need improvement. We also tend to be perfectionists, I find this to be partly true as I always believe that if you ever want to do something, you should do the job correctly.</p>

<header><p><strong>Ideal Job</strong>
		<br><br><img src="JobPete.jpg" width="800" class="center"> <br><br>
	</header>
	<p>My ideal job is to get into the field of Network Engineering / Cybersecurity. I previously studied Network Engineering/Administration at TAFE level and I quite enjoyed it and found it to be intriguing. Network Engineering is a job that requires planning, designing, implementing and maintaining a network system. I have always been quite interested in how computers and people can communicate with each other through network connectivity and the technology and hardware they use. Even the way technology has changed from when I was studying at TAFE level (2002) to now, it has excelled quite exponentially. I believe the world of Network Engineering to be a constantly evolving and expanding job field which I believe makes it more interesting, I love a challenge!</p>
