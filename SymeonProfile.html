					<p><strong>PLASSS-tech</strong>:
					<p>Student number: s3889431</p>
          <p>I am a 21-year-old first year student who completed the year 12 HSC back in 2016. My current
            plans are to go to Western Sydney University to study a Bachelor of Information and Communications
            Technology in early March 2021. My hobbies include playing sports, video games, and socialising
            with my friends whenever possible!</p>
          <p>My interest in IT stems from its exponential growth and importance within the modern world.
            The field of Cybersecurity is interesting to me as privacy and data are more vulnerable now
            than ever and being able to help both individuals and large businesses will provide a sense
            of fulfilment. IT support also stands out as a fulfilling role with being able to troubleshoot
            tech related issues and resolve them for the average computer user.</p>
          <p>I have no formal IT experience or qualifications; however, over the past 6 weeks I have been
            learning to utilise tools such as GitHub and Microsoft Teams, and learning how to write HTML & CSS.
            HTML has been very fun to learn as it provides a rewarding feeling once you see your code turn into
            a tangible webpage. I am willing to push myself and learn about all aspects of the IT field.</p>

				<br><h3><strong>Personality Tests </strong></h3><br>
</header>				
         
        <br>  <h4>Myers-Briggs test</h4> <br>
	
          <p>My results indicate that I am a campaigner ENFP-A type. These results suggest that my decisions
            are made mainly on gut feeling and intuition rather than logic and careful thought. This gives me
            a valuable perspective on future decisions as I will likely take a longer pause to think and
            deliberate, as opposed to trusting my heart straight away.</p>
         <br> <h4>Learning Styles test</h4> <br>
          <p>Scoring a 13 for “activist” for the Mumford and Honey LSQ confirms that a hands-on and open-minded
            style of learning is crucial for me to learn effectively and efficiently. This test shows that if
            we are doing something practical such as brainstorming as a group we can gain insight into each other
            and as a team.</p>
        <br>  <h4>Big Five Personality test</h4> <br>
          <p>Scoring 83% on the Big Five Personality Test for “agreeableness” also highlights my ability to
            understand and empathise with people regardless of their issue. Even though I may have not been through
            the same experience, it is necessary to remain optimistic and actively listen to the individual.</p>

	<p> <h3><strong> Ideal Job </strong> </h3>

	<img src="symjob2.jpg" width="800" class="center"> <br> <br>
	<p style="text-align: left;">Being an IT support technician revolves around the maintenance and instalment of computer systems and technology.
		They are also used to troubleshoot and solve technical issues which can be hardware or software related. This job is
		appealing to me as I would be able to help both ordinary people and larger businesses when they are facing technical
		problems that they cannot solve by themselves.</p>
		<p style="text-align: left;"> IT support technicians must have a wide range of skills and experience in many aspects of Information
			Technology.  Some of these skills may include hardware/software instalment and troubleshooting, programming, networking, and
			monitoring/maintenance of computer systems. A good IT support technician can work well in groups, communicate effectively, and
			have great customer service.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"> Currently I have no formal qualifications or skills needed for the role of IT support technician. My
	understanding of IT is overly broad with only a few weeks of learning specific areas within the subject.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">To gain the skills needed for the role, I will first need to complete a Bachelor of Information Technology.
	The degree will take 3 years of full-time study to complete and will be started in March of 2021. In 2024 after the degree completion,
	I will be qualified to work in a low-level Help Desk/IT support environment which I can utilise to hone and develop my skillset. There
	are a variety of entry-level help desk and IT jobs that will give me an effective, hands-on learning approach to IT support and often 
	involve working in a team with other experienced technicians. Working with other experienced technicians would aid my learning greatly
	as they can provide valuable feedback and challenge my perspective on certain topics or methods of work. I can also complete other
	courses/certificates such as “Windows Server 2016 Certification”, and the “CompTIA A+” program, which I will then use as qualifications
	to show my experience and knowledge to the employer for an IT support technician role. Both programs can be completed concurrently and
	will take under a year to complete, allowing me to have a bachelor’s degree and two recognised certifications within 4 years of study.
	Books such as “Tools and Weapons” by Brad Smith and Carol Ann Browne can be read to further supplement learning at my own pace. The book
	revolves around how technology is not only empowering, but also threatening us, which includes topics such as privacy and cyberattacks.
	I believe these topics are especially important and will only gain more significance as we progress into a tech driven world where our data
	and privacy are at risk.</p>
