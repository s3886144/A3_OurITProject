					<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
					<br>The aim of this project is to develop a Kids Storytime Application called: Read, Record & Rep. 
				Our app will allow parents to record stories for their kids and play it back at bedtime. 
				We will be aiming to record a short story to present to an investment audience. 
				Once we present this to the investment audience, we will be looking for a capital investment to 
				expand out app to over 1000 books.</br><br>The funding will go towards getting licences for copyrights on books,
		sourcing server space and for some recordings of some other voices such as soothing voices for relaxing bedtime stories.</br>
		<br>The motivation behind this project is that there is no other product like this one the market.
		We have identified a gap in the market and are aiming to get in first with this technology. 
		The importance of this project is that it can be used for people who work away such as mine sites, 
		so that young children will still be able to know their voices.</br><br>It would fit with current it 
	trends such as Learning Technology. This is an emerging trend with the rise of people learning from home since
	the pandemic it will be evermore increasing in the coming years.</br><br>By working on this project, it will 
show future employers that we are able to work as a team unit, well developed learning skills, adhere to deadlines, coordinated 
coverage of project items and strong communication skills.</br><br>The things that set us apart from competitors is our personalisation and the fact that parents have ultimate control over what the child can hear, see and learn.</br></p>

<a name="testing"></a>
									<p><strong>Testing</strong></p>
									<br>For this application to work well it will have to be systematically tested. This is so that bugs can be found and problems can be fixed before the application enters the market. Nobody wants to have an app that doesn’t do what it claims it will do, so we want to minimise the risk of failure with extensive testing.</br><br>Testing applications can come in many forms, initially; we would like to test the application on multiple devices. This will include Smartphones and Tablets and across a multitude of platforms. We will have to research the most common forms of devices and the operating systems they use to ensure the product works as it should on these devices. During the testing stage, it is also beneficial to run these applications through a simulator on a computer. These simulators (such as Reflector 3) can mimic the way a mobile device runs the program (Testbytes, 2019) and could give a relatively clear indication if the app is working. More testing could include making sure the app is compatible with various modes of the device including portrait and landscape and if the app can run on different settings in the Operating System. We could also test to see if the app runs in the parameters of the system with a performance test of the device under different workloads (Software Testing Help, 2021). When we are happy with the results of the app we will be prepared to move onto the next stage of development.</br><br>

									<p><strong>Group Processes and Communications</strong></p>
									<br>Understandingly, when doing group assessments, communication between members is always key to successful projects. PLASS-tech is made up out of 6 members from different backgrounds and are even separated by different time-zones. When we started our project together, we decided to set goals and expectations straight away and that having at least two meetings a week between all members was beneficial (Bonnie, 2017), but what would happen if there was a communication breakdown between members? Well simply, we have been using Microsoft Teams to communicate with each other from having the meetings to using the chat feature and, we are even using it to link our git-hub projects. A good feature of Microsoft Teams is that we are also getting emailed when a meeting is to take place so that if for some reason someone forgets that a meeting is coming up, they will see it in their outlook inbox. If a group member missed a meeting or stopped using Microsoft Teams we could also contact them through their RMIT email. In the short time we have been working together I believe that we have developed a great sense of familiarity with each other and that can only strengthen our project (Cornell University, 2016).</br>
