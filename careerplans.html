					<h2>Career Plans</h2>
				</header>
        <br></br>
<p> Our group members specialise in a wide variety of fields within IT. We have a cybersecurity network specialist, a learning technologist, game programmer,
  ICT support specialist, supply chain manager, and a compliance solution consultant and implementer. Each of us will be branching into different aspects of IT,
  however, many of the skills between the jobs are universal and required by all employers within IT work. Base skills such as communication, problem solving and
  organisation are utilised constantly throughout all career paths, alongside more specialised skills, such as MS Windows usage, building relationships, and technical support.  </p>

<p>Some of our groups’ ideal jobs also require specific tech related skills. To give some examples of this, Peter’s job (cybersecurity network specialist), requires proficiency in Cisco
  Technologies, and a strong understanding of Windows and Linux client-server system environments. These skills can be contrasted to Laura’s (game programmer) needed skills, which include
  a minimum of 5 years with C#, Unity and Unreal Engine programs. </p>

<p>The demand for all career paths of our group members is predicted to increase over the next few years and will continue to grow as more businesses and fields become reliant on IT work and assistance. </p>
