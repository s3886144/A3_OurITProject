					<p><strong>PLASSS-tech</strong>:
					<p>Student number: s3799302 </p>
          <p>I immigrated to Australia 8 years ago. Managed to get around quite a bit and used to live in a camper van. Finally, have settled in Melbourne and have running water again.
I am currently studying Bachelor of Business @ Rmit via Open Uni. This is my 8th unit. Wish I could speak another language, if I could choose one it to wake up and be able to speak it would be Japanese.
</p>
          <p>My interest comes from a want to learn how to code to help optimize business processes. Iâ€™ve always have had a keen interest but did not have the exposure growing up to develop my skills. To broaden my current IT skill set, I will be completing all 5 of my elective units for the course.</p>
          
	 <p>IA hobby of mine is watching my favourite sport, Football (or as Aussies call it, Soccer). This requires you to be awake at all hours of the night to watch EPL games in the UK.</p>

					<br><h3><strong> Personality Tests </strong></h3><br>
	</header>

	
          <h4>Myers-Briggs test</h4>
		
          <p>The results of my MBTI have indicated that I am a ESTJ - The Coordinators. I feel these test results are an accurate representation of my personality.</p>
         
	<h4>Learning Styles test</h4> 
          <p>Auditory Style</p>
          <h4>Personality test</h4>
          <p>The two results showed that I am confident in my own ability to succeed within my workplace and that I am Achievement driven. I scored 10/10 in the confidence test & 7/10 in the achievement test. Both scores are pretty accurate in how I go about my work and personal life.</p>

	<p>My ideal job would be to lead a national company as the Head of Supply Chain. To get to this role, It will take me finishing my degree and having a few years of experience in this field. Currently I work as a Transport Solution Designer and feel this is a good building block to progress further on my career path.</p>
        <p>As the head of Supply chain, I would have full control of the end-to-end process of landing goods in the most efficient and most cost-efficient way. To be successful it would require a high attention to detail and amazing depth of knowledge of Supply Chains.</p>
        <p>It also require a strong commercial background to ensure profitability. I am currently developing these required skills in my current role and look forward to expanding these vital skills in the coming years.</p>
