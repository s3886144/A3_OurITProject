					<strong>PLASSS-tech</strong></h3>

					<p>Student Number: s3886144</p>

					<p>I am a 37 year old mum of 2 very busy children (aged 5 and 3), living in regional NSW.</p>
					<p>I have qualifications including a Diploma of Information Technology and an ITIL Foundation Certificate in IT Service Management.</p>

					<p>My interest in IT developed around the time I finished school and entered the workforce. I was forced to learn the basics of computing and from there my curiosity continued to grow, as did my skill set. To my amazement, I had the ability to pick things up and learn quickly, I soon realised that computers and software were not that difficult to use, this was a real turning point in my developing interest in IT and my education pathway.
					Now I have a strong passion for IT, dedicated over 10years working in the field, and I have operated in many roles where I assist others to develop their skills using different technologies in the educational sector.</p>
					<p>Interesting fact about me: I never studied anything to do with computers at high school.</p>

				<br><h3><strong>Personality Tests </strong></h3><br>
</header>
					
					<p> <h4> Myer Briggs Test</h4>
					Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) = Defender</p>

					<p><h4>Learning Style Test</h4>
					Learning Style Indicator = Visual</p>

					<p><h4> Creativity Self-Test></h4>
					Creativity Self-Test Indicator = 61 out of 80</p>

					<p>These personal profiling results come as no surprise to me, I 100% agree with the outcomes and their accuracy.
					In a team environment I am generally the quiet one who listens/observes then
					 makes comments and/or then contributes, which is a clear trait of the Defender personality type.
					 Group dynamics and personality types influence a team greatly,
					by having the right combination of personalities that can be the difference between
					a high performing cohesive team and/or a team frustrated by others and causing conflict.<br>

					As a visual learner and someone who has a creative strength, I strongly prefer to watch or have something
					demonstrated to me when learning something new. I then I like to add my own style and flair,
					when moving forward with either completing the task or showing others.</p>

					<p>The Learning Technologist role at Melbourne Polytechnic is an appealing role to me, the role is in the field of education plus the role is primarily responsible for fostering the learning of cutting edge and innovative technology to a variety of stakeholders (secondary school students, community and industry partners). This role is similar, but of a higher level, to what I have had exposure and experience in.
					The skills, qualifications and experience required for the role, as indicated, include a degree or postgraduate degree or equivalent qualification, high level of knowledge and experience in a variety of different technologies and leadership abilities.
					The current skills, qualifications and experience I have accumulated over the years, is inline with progressing towards a similar role, and one day I hope to achieve the capabilities to succeed in such position. By starting my studies at RMIT with the unit Introduction to Technology, I hope to proceed and complete my Bachelors Degree in Information Technology. The experience I have gained from my past roles is incredible valuable. </p>
