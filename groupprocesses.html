<p> For Assignment 2, we all believe and feel that this was overall a positive group experience. As a team we all had the same goal/focus on achieving and
completing this assignment. Our team demonstrated exemplary desired team qualities whereby members were able to openly ask for assistance and it was no
trouble at all for another member to step up and assist.</p>

<p>The new changes weâ€™ll be implementing for Assignment 3 will be to have an earlier start on tackling the larger portions of our project and paying close
attention to details around task allocation, to avoid work duplication. This will enable better organization between team members to complete our assignment
within the given timeframe. </p>
